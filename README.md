Amazone Sales ANALYSIS
🚀 Excited to share my latest Data Analysis project!

In this project, I worked on an Amazon sales dataset where I focused on data cleaning, transformation, and KPI analysis using SQL and Power BI.

🔹 SQL Tasks:

Cleaned the data (handling NULLs, duplicates, and incorrect values)

Created aggregated queries to calculate:

Total Sales

Number of Orders (using DISTINCT logic)

Quantity Sold

Average Order Value

Applied time-based analysis using:

Month-over-Month (MoM)

Year-over-Year (YoY)

Year-to-Date (YTD)

🔹 Power BI Tasks:

Built a proper Calendar Table for time intelligence

Created dynamic DAX measures:

Total Sales

Number of Orders

Average Order Value

MoM & YoY comparisons

YTD calculations

Designed an interactive dashboard to track sales performance and trends .

Let’s Connect!
I’m excited to learn from feedback and exchange ideas with fellow data enthusiasts.
